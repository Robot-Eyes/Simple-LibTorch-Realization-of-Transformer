# Simple-LibTorch-Realization-of-Transformer

<img src="transformer_cpp.png" alt="Transformer in C++" width="600">

There are probably one million python realizations of transformer, but definitely fewer ones in C++. So I implemented a very simple transformer model using LibTorch in C++, just as a learning exercise in deep learning and programming. It includes the **model** and **data** parts, as well as **training** and **testing** scripts. As I said, very simple.
